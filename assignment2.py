# A fairy tale has been stored in a string in the variable `fairy_tale` below. We want to use string methods to manipulate this string and to gain information about the string.

fairy_tale = "Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a beautiful princess named Anya. She was kind and gentle, but she was also very lonely. Her parents had died when she was young, and she had no siblings.  One day, while walking in the garden, Anya saw a small, green frog sitting on a lily pad. She felt sorry for the frog and picked it up. As soon as she touched it, the frog turned into a handsome prince! The prince thanked Anya for freeing him from his curse and told her that he was the prince of a neighboring kingdom. He had been turned into a frog by a wicked witch as punishment for breaking his promise to her. Anya and the prince fell in love and were married. They lived happily ever after, ruling their kingdoms together and bringing peace and prosperity to their people."
